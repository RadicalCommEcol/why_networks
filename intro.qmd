## Networks are tools

-   Things interact with things

-   Simple systems do not require complex network theory

-   Complex systems can benefit from network theory.

## Lord of the rings example

(for Jose)

## What is a network

-   Topology

    -   Nodes (vertices)

    -   Links (edges)

    -   Layers

-   Dynamics

    -   Fake dynamics

    -   Deterministic L-V type equations

    -   Structural stability conditions

    -   Diffusion dynamics

## Types of networks

-   Unipartite - Bipartite - Tripartite

-   Directed - Indirected

-   Weigthed unweigthed

-   Meta-webs

## Networks as matrices

-   Adjacency matrix

-   Simetric / Asymetric

-   Block matrices (collections of incidence matrix)

## Levels of structure

-   Macroscale: emergent properties

    -   e.g. Nestedness

-   Mesoscale: indirect interactions

    -   e.g. Motifs

-   Microscale: the role of nodes.

    -   e.g. Degree

## Questions first

-   If you don't have a question, do not use networks.

-   How index X changes along Y is not a question.

## Examples

-   Model pollen flow: random walk modularity "a la Allen-Perkins"

-   Identify conservation priority areas: Strength (Marini et al.)

-   Measure evidence of competition: Niche metrics (Magrach et al)

-   Assess foraging flexibility: Beta-diversity of interactions (Noreika et al.)

## Examples

-   Identify species outcomes: Closeness centrality (Arroyo et al.)

-   Assess stability: Topological imprints on Structural Stability (Garc√≠a-Callejas et al.)

-   Identify general structural patterns: Motifs (Lanuza et al.)

## Be aware of correlations

-   e.g. Conectance vs Network size

-   e.g. Nestedness vs degree distribution.

-   Null models can only take you that far.

## Indexes are misused. 

-   Read the assumptions

-   Interpret them accordingly

-   The simpler it is, the less likely to misinterpret it.

-   Examples:

    -   WNODF

    -   d'

    -   niche overlap

    -   PSI

## Other stuff

-   Be aware of sampling design / intensity

    -   Plant vs pollinator centered

    -   Equal vs representative effort

    -   Missing links

    -   Taxonomic issues

-   Same names imply different calculations (e.g. modularity)
